# OpenScanZero
The cheapest OpenScan Zero 3D scanner project (Mini/Midi)

The title is true if you have a mini milling machine and a Raspberry Zero 2W ;-)
Raspberry zero differs in minimal configuration, so I got rid of the optional connector in my scanner.
The advantages of the project are a lower price and no problems with the camera.
